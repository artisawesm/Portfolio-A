# Art's Online Portfolio

I know this is the worst website ever but at least I got one. *walk away with confidence
This is my first though so there are changes that should be done with regards to my
code structure and techniques.

I am willing to accept my failure and you can suggest something or give me an advice regarding front-end web development
that will help me a lot.

Enjoy!
